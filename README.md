# Cake.Yaml

A set of aliases for [cakebuild.net](http://cakebuild.net) to help with YAML Serialization.

![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3ttdasxutw5r8v7d/branch/master?svg=true)

You can easily reference Cake.Yaml directly in your build script via a cake addin:

```csharp
#addin nuget:?package=Cake.Yaml
#addin nuget:?package=YamlDotNet&version=5.2.1
```

NOTE: It's very important at this point in time to specify the `YamlDotNet` package *and* the version _5.2.1_ for it.

## Aliases
