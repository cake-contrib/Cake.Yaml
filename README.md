You can easily reference Cake.Yaml directly in your build script via a Cake addin:

```csharp
#addin nuget:?package=Cake.Yaml&version=4.0.0
#addin nuget:?package=YamlDotNet&version=6.1.2
```

NOTE: It's very important at this point in time to specify the `YamlDotNet` package *and* the version _6.1.2_ for it.

## Aliases
